    <h2 style="text-align:center;color:white;"> VACANCY </h2>
<p style="background-color:silver;"> Good day, my name is victor Okeke I am writing this message with faith, I saw the address on twitter from a post of 2 years ago. I am a graduate of human anatomy with numerous experience in different sectors of life and a whole lot of digital skills. I speak Igbo, Hausa, Yoruba and other languages. I am hardworking resilient and disciplined in anything I do. Below is an attachment of my cv thanks and God bless in advance.</p>

<p style="color:white;"> Fundamentally, banks earn money by lending the money you deposit to
  other people. For example, if you deposit $1,000, a Big Bank will pay you
  0.5 percent to hold on to that money, and then they’ll turn around and lend
  it out at 7 percent for a home loan</p>

<strong style="color:red; text-align:center;"> This is a warning! glance once</strong>
<p style="color:green; background-color: azure;"> The most painful and expensive fees are usually overdraft fees—which is the fee
  your bank charges you if you don’t have enough money in your checking
  account to cover a purchase. Of course, the best way to avoid overdraft fees is to
  not let them happen in the first place. Set up automatic transfers and keep a cash
  cushion in your account (I keep about $1,000 in my checking at all times). But
  mistakes do happen. Most banks understand that people are occasionally
  forgetful and they’ll waive a first-time fee if you ask. After the first time, it gets
  harder but can still be done if you have a good excuse. Remember: They want to
  keep you as their customer. A well-executed phone call can often make a
  difference. But when calling, keep in mind that you should have a clear goal (to
  get your fee erased) and should not make it easy for companies to say no to you</p>
